# Laravel Shopping API

There are several API endpoints available which can easily be accessed on `http://shopping.test` using an API client such as [Postman](https://www.getpostman.com/) or [Insomnia](https://insomnia.rest/).

All of the following endpoints are designed to take and eventually return JSON data. Hence, use the following request headers for every call:

```
Content-Type: application/json
Accept: application/json
```
